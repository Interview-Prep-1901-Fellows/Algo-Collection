/* Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
  You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
  You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.  
  _Your algorithm’s **runtime complexity** must be in the order of O(log n)._
  **Example 1:**    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 0  -->   4
  **Example 2:**    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 3  -->  -1  */
