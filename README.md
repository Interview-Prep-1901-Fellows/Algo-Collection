# Algo-Collection

This is our repo for solved algorithms. If you have an alternative solution to a problem that's already in here, feel free to add your solution (especially if it's more efficient) below the one already included.

Also, please edit any of the solutions if you have an idea about how to improve the code. (It could be as simple as changing a 'let' to a 'const'.)

If you want to organize the docs into categories (e.g. sorting, permutations, subsets), go for it!
