# Algo-Collection

This is our repo for solved algorithms. 

If you have an alternative solution to a problem that's already in here, feel free to add your solution below the one already included. If it's more efficient, it would be great to add a note about that.

Also, please edit any of the solutions if you have an idea about how to improve the code. (It could be as simple as changing a 'let' to a 'const'.) If you want to add the BigO for a problem that doesn't have it, please do.

Finally, if you want to organize the docs into categories (e.g. sorting, permutations, subsets), go for it!
